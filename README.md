# Automation-Testing
Contains Testscripts that are created by Anthony McSharry

In this test script my objective was to create an E2E test script of of a widley used Web application.
The application I had chosen was Amazon.co.uk, My objective was to automate an E2E Test of the typical Amazon Customer purchase process.

The E2E Process covers the following:
1. Sign in
2. Locate user selected Item
3. Select Users custom preference of item
4. Add item to basket
5. Bring item to checkout

There were a few limitations to this E2E Process which I have listed below:
-The E2E Test will not include the payment process of an item.
-Amazon elements changed much more frequently than anticipated, making it impossible to keep a working script without regular script Maintenance.
